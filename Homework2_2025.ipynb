    "3. It is a template also for the report that you upload in Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks are of various types: some are to read some text and then comment on it (no coding), and some are about creating visualisations using plotnine. Once you have finished all the tasks, export this document as an HTML file and upload it in Canvas. \n",

    "The goal of these homeworks is to learn how to improve your skills in visualising your science. You solve the homeworks in groups, however annotate all the code (even the theoretical parts) with who solved each question. **Eventhough the homework is submitted as a group you will be *individually* evaluated**.

    "\n",
    "During Lecture 3, we discussed colour palettes for categorical data. Briefly describe and motivate the three key properties we want a good categorical colour palette to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.1\n",

    "* Distinct enough from each other so one can quickly match with legend\n",
    "\n",
    "* Colorblind-friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to name! (No \"maroon\" vs \"dark red\" confusion!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lecture 3, we used pie and bar charts to visualise proportions. Briefly discuss the benefits and drawbacks with using bar charts and pie charts for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.2\n",
    "* Pie charts show \"part of whole\" intuitively at a glance... but it's hard to tell exact amounts from angles, so each circle section must be complemented with numbers, which can be noisy and lead to overlap. It especially gets noisy when there are many groups within the pie chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bar charts make it easier to compare values accurately and are readable even when there are 10+ groups... but they give less of an immediate sense of \"part of whole\" like pie charts do, and they also take up more space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lecture 3, we used a mosaic plot to analyse the Titanic data. Now consider Fig. 11.3 in the course book, what are the main takeaways we can read from this visual?\n",
