    "This is the first worksheet in the course *Scientific Visualisation*. This Jupyter notebook has three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It describes the tasks.\n",
    "2. It (sometimes) provides coding templates that you can use as a basis for your own code.\n",
    "3. It is a template also for the report that you upload in Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks are of various types: some are to read some text and then comment on it (no coding), and some are about creating visualisations using plotnine. Once you have finished all the tasks, export this document as an HTML file and upload it in Canvas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these homeworks is to learn how to improve your skills in visualising your science. You solve the homeworks in groups, however annotate all the code (even the theoretical parts) with who solved each question. **Eventhough the homework is submitted as a group you will be *individually* evaluated**. Motivate your choice of graph, legend, colourmap etc below your graph in a separate cell. \n",
